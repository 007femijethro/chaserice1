                <p>Chase Rice was born on December 19, 1985, in Asheville, North Carolina. He was a standout athlete and played linebacker for the University of North Carolina (UNC). After college, a personal tragedy—the death of his father—led him to reevaluate his life.</p>

                <p>He moved to Florida to work on a NASCAR pit crew for driver Jimmie Johnson but soon began focusing on music. His experience on Survivor: Nicaragua (filmed in 2010) gave him a small financial cushion ($100,000 for second place) which he used to fund his early music career.</p>

                <h3 class="card-title">Breakthrough with "Cruise"</h3>
                <p>In 2012, Rice co-wrote "Cruise" with his friends Tyler Hubbard and Brian Kelley of Florida Georgia Line. The song became a cultural phenomenon, breaking records for longest-running No. 1 hit on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart at the time.</p>

                <p>He independently released his album "Dirt Road Communion" (2012) and the EP "Ready Set Roll" (2013), which contained the popular title track. He signed with Columbia Nashville and released his major-label debut album, "Ignite the Night" (2014). It debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart and No. 3 on the all-genre Billboard 200, fueled by the hit "Ready Set Roll."</p>

                <h3 class="card-title">Continued Success</h3>
                <p>His later albums, "Lambs & Lions" (2017) and "The Album" (2021), showed an evolution in his sound, blending traditional country themes with modern production. The triple-platinum single "Eyes On You" from Lambs & Lions became his biggest solo hit to date, reaching No. 1 on Country radio.</p>

                <p>In 2021, he left his major label and founded Bad Realm Records. He released a more raw and personal project, "The Album Part I" and "Part II" under his new label. His 2023 single, "Bad Day to Be a Beer," became a hit, proving his ability to succeed on his own terms.</p>
