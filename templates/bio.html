                <h3 class="card-title">From Football to Music</h3>
                <p>Chase Rice was born on December 19, 1985, in Asheville, North Carolina. He was a standout athlete and played linebacker for the University of North Carolina (UNC). After college, a personal tragedy—the death of his father—led him to reevaluate his life.</p>

                <p>He moved to Florida to work on a NASCAR pit crew for driver Jimmie Johnson but soon began focusing on music. His experience on Survivor: Nicaragua (filmed in 2010) gave him a small financial cushion ($100,000 for second place) which he used to fund his early music career.</p>

                <h3 class="card-title">Breakthrough with "Cruise"</h3>
                <p>In 2012, Rice co-wrote "Cruise" with his friends Tyler Hubbard and Brian Kelley of Florida Georgia Line. The song became a cultural phenomenon, breaking records for longest-running No. 1 hit on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart at the time.</p>

                <p>He independently released his album "Dirt Road Communion" (2012) and the EP "Ready Set Roll" (2013), which contained the popular title track. He signed with Columbia Nashville and released his major-label debut album, "Ignite the Night" (2014). It debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart and No. 3 on the all-genre Billboard 200, fueled by the hit "Ready Set Roll."</p>

                <h3 class="card-title">Independent Artist Success</h3>
                <p>His later albums, "Lambs & Lions" (2017) and "The Album" (2021), showed an evolution in his sound, blending traditional country themes with modern production. The triple-platinum single "Eyes On You" from Lambs & Lions became his biggest solo hit to date, reaching No. 1 on Country radio.</p>

                <p>In 2021, he left his major label and founded Bad Realm Records, embracing creative independence. He released "The Album Part I" and "Part II" under his new label, followed by "Go Down Singin'" in 2024. His 2023 single, "Bad Day to Be a Beer," became a hit, proving his ability to succeed on his own terms.</p>
