#Project: Chase Rice Fanpage Starter
Built for Replit. Files are separated by markers. Copy each file into your Replit project.


Structure:
- index.html
- about.html
- music.html
- raffle.html
- contact.html
- assets/ (placeholders)
- js/main.js
- js/raffle.js
- css/styles.css (minimal; Tailwind used via CDN)


Notes:
- This starter uses Tailwind via CDN for simplicity.
- Raffle entries are stored in localStorage for demo. Replace with a backend when ready.
- Replace placeholder images and links with real assets.
